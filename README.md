# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The initial page should be the portfolio page. From there you can click the links, such as "contact" and "about" links, and it will direct you towards the different pages. The colum "col-" was used to fit all page sizes and and apps. Therefore the same lay out will remain inspite of changing screen size.
Nav bars and conatact layout were used from the bootstrap website. Google foo was used to wrap the text around the image in the "about me" section. When hovering over the image in "about me" the pseduo classes are visible in the outline. Clicking my name in each page will direct you towards my instagram. When clicking the search bar in the "about me" section you should be directed towards google foo.
